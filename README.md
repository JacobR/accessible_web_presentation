# Accessible Web Presentation

The full presentation and exported pdf for a lesson I gave on accessible web design.

The presentation was created using [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com), the markdown-based presentation system for Mac. Should also be compatible with [remark](http://remarkjs.com/) with minor tweaking.
